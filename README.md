# Interactive GenAI & Physics Experiments

A collection of high-performance web applications exploring the intersection of Generative AI, Astrophysics, and Interactive UI Design. This monorepo contains experiments built primarily with React 19, TypeScript, and the HTML5 Canvas API.

## Project Catalog

### Astrophysics & Simulation

#### 1. [Star Synthesizer](./star-synthesizer)
**An interactive audio-visual experiment exploring the sonification of stellar astrophysics.**
* **Core Concept:** Translates physical stellar parameters (Temperature, Mass, Metallicity, Age) into specific audio synthesis techniques (Subtractive, FM, Granular).
* **Tech:** Web Audio API, Canvas API, React 19.
* **Key Feature:** Hear the difference between a young, unstable protostar and an ancient Red Giant.

#### 2. [Gravity Lens Simulator](./gravity-simulator)
**High-fidelity visualization of orbital mechanics under intense gravitational fields.**
* **Core Concept:** A "spacetime sandbox" that combines Newtonian mechanics for particle movement with an artistic vertex displacement shader to simulate Gravitational Lensing.
* **Tech:** Velocity Verlet / Semi-Implicit Euler Integrator, Canvas API.
* **Key Feature:** Visualizes the "Einstein Ring" effect and allows for orbital injection around a central singularity.

#### 3. [Fermi Paradox Computing Terminal](./fermi-paradox-dashboard)
**A brutalist exobiological simulator for the Drake Equation.**
* **Core Concept:** Calculates the potential number of active civilizations (N) in real-time while simulating the "Galactic Graveyard".
* **Tech:** Node.js.
* **Key Feature:** "Deep Scan" functionality that uses AI to generate a sci-fi narrative diagnosis based on your specific simulation parameters.

#### 4. [Red-Shift Architect (Exo-Planet Builder)](./exo-planet-builder)
**Deterministic procedural generation engine for exoplanets.**
* **Core Concept:** Combines raw mathematical pixel rendering (no assets) with Neural Lore Synthesis.
* **Tech:** Custom Noise Algorithms, Gemini 2.5 Flash.
* **Key Feature:** The visuals are deterministic code; the history is AI hallucination. Creates unique, low-fidelity artifacts with deep lore.

### Artificial Intelligence & UI

#### 5. [Lumina Chatbot](./lumina-chatbot)
**Next-Generation Semantic Search E-Commerce Experience.**
* **Core Concept:** Replaces traditional filters with a conversational AI stylist that understands intent, context, and style.
* **Tech:** Gemini 2.5 Flash, Weighted Scoring Algorithms, Pollinations.ai.
* **Key Feature:** Frontend-First Architecture. Features "Sticky Context" (remembers gender/preferences) and "Honest AI" fallback to prevent hallucinations when inventory is missing.

### Conceptual Experiments

#### 6. [The Infinite Scroll](./infinite-scroll)
**A 1:1 scale physical scrolling experiment.**
* **Core Concept:** Distance is relative, until now. A digital ruler calibrated to ensure that 1 meter of digital depth corresponds exactly to 1 meter of physical scroll interaction.
* **Tech:** Vanilla JS (Zero-Dependency), HTML5, CSS3.
* **Key Feature:** Features an "Infinite Treadmill" engine to bypass browser pixel limits, dynamic biomes based on depth, and a hidden "Minus World" glitch mechanic.

## Common Technical Stack

* **Framework:** React 19 (Hooks based architecture)
* **Language:** TypeScript 5.0+ (Strict typing)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
