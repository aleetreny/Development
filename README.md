#  Development Portfolio

Welcome to my **Development** repository.

This collection houses my **Software Engineering** and **Full-Stack Application** projects. While my Data Science work focuses on analysis, modeling, and statistical research, the projects here demonstrate my ability to build robust, user-facing applications, integrate APIs, and design modern architectures.

##  Projects
