# RED-SHIFT ARCHITECT

## [ DESCRIPTION ]

Red-Shift Architect is a deterministic procedural generation engine designed to catalogue the infinite anomalies of the outer rim. It combines raw mathematical pixel rendering with advanced neural synthesis to create collectible, low-fidelity exoplanet artifacts.

Unlike standard generative tools, this system does not hallucinate images. The visuals are grounded in code—rendered instantly via HTML5 Canvas algorithms based on your specific input telemetry. The narrative, however, is pulled from the void by the Gemini AI Core, providing deep, often unsettling lore for each discovery.

## [ CORE DIRECTIVES ]

### 1. DETERMINISTIC VISUALS
The visual representation of every planet is mathematically generated using custom noise functions and pixel manipulation directly in the browser.
- Same Parameters = Same Planet.
- 100% Client-side rendering.
- Zero latency image generation.

### 2. NEURAL LORE SYNTHESIS
While the visuals are cold code, the history is organic chaos. We utilize Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to generate:
- Unique planetary designations.
- Cosmic horror myths and historical catastrophes.
- Detailed analysis of dominant lifeforms and civilizations.
- Resource scanning reports.

### 3. RETRO-INDUSTRIAL INTERFACE
- Monochromatic "Code Red" aesthetic.
- Simulated CRT monitor degradation (Scanlines, Flicker, Chromatic Aberration).
- Pixel-perfect typography using VT323 and Press Start 2P.

## [ PARAMETER VECTORS ]

The Architect allows modulation of 10 distinct planetary variables to influence the generation:

- PLANET TYPE (Gas Giant, Shattered World, Living Organism...)
- ATMOSPHERE (Toxic Green, Plasma Red, Void Black...)
- SURFACE (Bio-Mechanical Flesh, Crystal Spires...)
- LIQUID (Molten Lava, Acid, Blood...)
- CIVILIZATION (Hive Mind, Post-Singularity, Extinct...)
- DANGER LEVEL (Safe -> Existential Threat)
- And more...

## [ OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS ]

### PREREQUISITES
- Node.js Environment
- Valid Google Gemini API Key

### INITIALIZATION

1. Clone the repository to local sector.
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Configure environmental variables:
   Create a .env file and input your API credentials.
   API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

4. Execute launch sequence:
   npm start

## [ EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY ]

Successfully scanned planets can be downloaded as .PNG artifacts. These files are yours to catalogue, trade, or archive before the system purges the cache.

## [ TECH STACK ]

- React 19
- TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas API (Procedural Rendering)
- Tailwind CSS
